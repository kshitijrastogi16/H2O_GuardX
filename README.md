# 💧 H2O_GuardX

> A Smart AI-Powered Water Quality Surveillance System  
> Designed for real-time monitoring, prediction, and safety compliance in water distribution and industrial environments.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**H2O_GuardX** is a full-stack water quality monitoring solution integrating:

- 🧪 Sensor-based data simulation and analysis  
- 🤖 Machine Learning for quality prediction & anomaly detection  
- 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI) for transparency in decision-making  
- 📄 Automated reporting & structured documentation

This system was developed as part of a **final-year Major Project** at **SRM University**, addressing real-world challenges in water safety and smart industry standards.
